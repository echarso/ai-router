1.1 System Administrator (SA)
A System Administrator has the following responsibilities:
- View all organization users in the UX (the users are in Keycloak).
- Through the UI assign users to the correct organization; this should be reflected in backend systems.
- Create in the UI organization users and save them in Keycloak and assign them the Organization Administrator (OA) role.
- Assign newly created OAs to an organization during user creation.
- Be in position to create an organization via the UI and reflect this in the backend systems.

1.2 Organization Administrator (OA)
An Organization Administrator:
- Must belong to exactly one organization.
- Can create and manage Projects within their organization. This should happen from the UI.
- From the UI can create API Keys for their organization. Reflect this to OpenBao.
- From the UI can assign API Keys to one or more projects within the same organization.

When an OA creates an API Key, the UI must allow configuration of the following fields:
- Reference name
- Expiration (in days)
- Rate limits
- Traffic policies

So the relevant above entries in the UI are needed.

3 Persistence
All API Key configurations and relations with projects and organizations must be stored in:
- OpenBao (for secret management)
- PostgreSQL (for metadata and relational data)

Users with the Organization Administrator role must have their organization name included as a group claim in their token
- The organization claim must be reflected in the issued access token.
- Backend services must rely on this token claim to determine organization context and authorization.
